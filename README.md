The course introduces students to beginner programmer concepts using the Python language. As the course progresses students work on homework assignments that are merged and submitted to GitHub on a weekly basis after week 3 to create a simple Python object-oriented application with a Windows interface using Tkinter.

The idea for this Python project was derived from Microsoft's MVC Contoso University application. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application

In addition, the main Python desktop interface where the app switches frames used a solution I found in StackOverflow.com http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26213549/switching-between-frames-in-tkinter-menu
